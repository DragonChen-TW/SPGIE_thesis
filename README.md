## Project Structure

This project contains two main parts: `training` and `explaining`.

The checkpoint files are stored under `checkpoints` folder.
The generated dataset files are stored under `dataset` folder.

Both of `checkpoints` and `dataset` are not tracked by Git. 
You can download them through my cloud drive(WIP).
